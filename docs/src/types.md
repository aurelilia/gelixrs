# Types

Now it's time to learn about more advanced
datatypes and how to use them.

Gelix implements the following types for you to define:
- Classes, which you read about in the last chapter
- Interfaces, which allow defining shared behavior between types
- Enums, which are used to replace OOP-style inheritance in gelix
- Closures, which are functions treatable like data
- Nullables, which are not a type by themselves, but still quite important
