# Welcome

Welcome to the gelix documentation! 
This book serves as both an introduction to the language as well as its specification.

The intended audience for this book is programmers with previous experience,
ideally in a strongly typed language with C-like syntax like gelix.
Some experience with memory management, mainly the differentiation between stack
and heap, are expected as well; they are however optional.

Should you find any issues in this book like spelling errors or behavior 
inconsistent with that of gelix, feel free to open a bug on the
[gelix issue tracker](https://git.angm.xyz/ellie/gelixrs).

Note that gelix and all the projects related to it are still in active
development. They *should* work as described, but are not yet production-ready
and breakage is to be expected. The gelix syntax and general language features
are still being worked on and can change at any time.

### Current status

Gelix was mainly intended as a way for me to learn more about programming language
development, and it has fulfilled that purpose. Because of this, it is no longer
being actively worked on and *should not be used for any production use*.
