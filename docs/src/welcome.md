# Welcome

Welcome to the gelix documentation! 
This book serves as both an introduction to the language as well as its specification.

The intended audience for this book is programmers with previous experience,
ideally in a strongly typed language with C-like syntax like gelix.

Should you find any issues in this book like spelling errors or behavior 
inconsistent with that of gelix, feel free to open a bug on the
[gelix issue tracker](https://gitea.angm.xyz/ellie/gelixrs).
